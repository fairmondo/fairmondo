# To make a model commentable:
# + include Commentable (in model)
# + concerns: [:commentable] (in routes.rb)
# + add comments_count column to the model's table
# + add the class to COMMENTABLES (in CommentsController)
# + render "comments/commentable_comments", commentable: resource (in view)
# + make sure there is an ID on the element surrounding that render like #library17
